### INTRODUCTION 
#### Firstly, I look for an NBA database on Kaggle. This database shows all players, with some information about them such as their height, which team they belong to or the points they have scored. Once this is achieved, I clean the dataset to keep the information that is useful for me to compare it with the API obtained from the NBA website. 
### PROCESS
#### I generate an analysis based on plots, in which I get the maximum points of each player and the average. The only drawback, is that I find certain problems to develop the analysis of the API, because I can make the DataFrame, but I can not undo it properly to get the information I need, which are the columns of "home_team" and "visitor_team". That's where I was going to get the player ID for each team.
